I just purchased a thrity dollar quadcopter and I cannot wait for it to arrive.

I know this quadcopter has been around for awhile and is normaly $59.99 but
Amazon has it for around 30 dollars.  Many other cheap quadrotors use an
[IR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared) controller, making it impossibe to
fly the quad with the blinds up, however this one is in the 2.4GHz RF band. 

According to my Amazon account it should arrive on Tuesday. I will write
another post about how the quad flys and hopefully an detailed internal
hardware teardown. 
 
So come back in a week and I should have a more detailed post.
